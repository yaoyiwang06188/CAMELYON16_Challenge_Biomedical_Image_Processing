Digital pathology is a new, rapidly expanding field of medical imaging. The goal of this project is to build up deep neural networks to assist pathologists in identifying tumor cell location and reduce their workload.

We have include 4 different models in the "models" folder
Best Model: stacked_model_3.h5 (the patches slice from level3)
We also include submodel_lv4.h5 (zoom out at level4), submodel_lv5.h5 (zoom out at level5), submodel_lv5.h5(ensemble on level 3, level4, and level5 models)in the model folder
